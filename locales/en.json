Specialization combined with interdisciplinary can ensure precision and creativity. I am an artist with an analytical mind. When I do something - I try to do it the best I can. Musical education and working in this profession have taught me to be scrupulous: I am creative, but also precise. I create websites, I play the bassoon, I am a bassoon school teacher - in all these aspects I strive for perfection."
